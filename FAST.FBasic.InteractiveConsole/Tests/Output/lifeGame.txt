Each cell can have only two other cells in side areas. If more will die. Choose a clear notation

I changed the Game of Life to only count the two side neighbors (left and right) instead of all 8 surrounding cells. The new rules are: a live cell stays alive if it has exactly 1 or 2 live side neighbors, otherwise it dies (from isolation with 0 neighbors or overcrowding with more than 2). A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 2 live side neighbors. This creates a one-dimensional-like behavior where patterns propagate horizontally across rows, with each row evolving independently based only on left-right relationships. Cells can no longer be influenced by diagonal or vertical neighbors, fundamentally changing the dynamics from Conway's complex 2D patterns to simpler horizontal wave-like behaviors.
