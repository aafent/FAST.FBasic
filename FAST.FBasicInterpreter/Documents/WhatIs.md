### What FBASIC is and what it is not

FBASIC is a programming language specifically designed to be authored by application software, not by human programmers. Its primary purpose is to provide an easy and configurable way for applications to incorporate logic. This makes it suitable for serving as the back end for various systems, including business rule engines, flow chart diagrams, configuration scripts, and user-defined checks. It is an extendable and lightweight language that prioritizes ease of integration and efficient execution (interpretation). Due to its design, it only performs a light syntax check, as it assumes that the application generating the code will not introduce errors. However, if an error does exist in the source program, it will lead to an execution error.

Crucially, FBASIC is not intended to be a replacement for other programming languages. It does not operate with strong programming checks or rigid rules. Unlike languages designed for programmers, it deliberately pays little attention to syntactical mistakes, as it's not meant to be a language for a person to write code in. Therefore, it lacks the robust error-checking mechanisms found in traditional programming languages.
